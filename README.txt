This repository contains Jupyter notebooks capable of reproducing the figures in 
"Physical constraints during Snowball Earth drive the evolution of multicellularity."

Each notebook contains the parameters and functions required for one of the three 
models developed and presented in this paper. 

Jupyter Notebooks were written in Python 3.11.3, using Matplotlib 3.7.1 and Numpy 2.8.4
